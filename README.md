# Space Miners

A play-to-earn game where miners travel to the far ends of the galaxy through portals to recover GEMs! A miners payout will be effected by the bag size (GEMs capacity each trip) and the return time from trips. On launch players will be able to mint a limited amount of portals to assist miners in travelling the galaxy for a fee. Portal owners can receive these fees by chance upon a miners return, and before-hand a random number is generated using `Chainlink's VRF` to prevent foul play and decide which portal will be rewarded.

`SpaceMiners.sol` is where miners and portals are minted, and the contract players use to send their miners on missions
`Gem.sol` is the GEM contract used for game rewards
